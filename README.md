# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a **face recognition system** using machine learning techniques. It can detect and recognize faces from images, videos, or live camera feeds.

## Features
- ✅ Face detection and recognition
- 🎭 Support for multiple faces
- ⚡ Real-time processing
- 📁 Dataset training and model saving
- 🔗 Integration with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks

## Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🎥 **OpenCV**
- 🤖 **Dlib / FaceNet / DeepFace** (Choose the one you are using)
- 🔢 **NumPy**
- 🧠 **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (If using deep learning models)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-project.git
   cd face-recognition-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download or prepare your dataset for training.

## Usage
1. Run the **face detection** script:
   ```bash
   python detect_faces.py
   ```
2. Run the **face recognition** script:
   ```bash
   python recognize_faces.py
   ```
3. Train a new model (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Dataset
📂 Use publicly available datasets like **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** or create a custom dataset.

## Future Improvements
- 📈 Improve recognition accuracy with deep learning models
- 🖥️ Add **GUI** for easier interaction
- 🌍 Deploy as a **web or mobile application**
